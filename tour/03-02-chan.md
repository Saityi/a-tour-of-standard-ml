Channels are a typed conduit through which you can send and receive values with the channel `send` and `recv` functions.

```sml
(* Send to channel ch *)
- send (ch, v);
(* Receive from ch and give it a name v *)
- val v = recv ch;
```

Note that `send` is a blocking operation. It will not return until another thread attempts to `recv`.
