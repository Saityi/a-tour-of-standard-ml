You may frequently avoid direct recursion by use of higher-order functions: pass in a function to another function, which then handles the details of iteration or aggregation using your passed in the function. Examples include:

- `map f xs`, which applies a function `f` to each element in `xs`, creating a new list
- `List.filter p xs`, which filters a list using a predicate `p`, creating a new list containing any items that returned `true` for `p x`
- `foldr c s xs` lets you combine the items of a list to a summary value, using some combining operation `c` and a starting value `s`
