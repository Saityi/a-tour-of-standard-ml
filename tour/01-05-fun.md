As the single argument `fn` form is harder to work with, there is syntactic sugar for declaring functions of any number of arguments: `fun`. Here we declare `add`, which has the same behaviour as the `add` from before, but with a simpler definition. Function arguments may be given type declarations if desired, but they are not necessary, as SML can infer them.

Functions may accept a tupled argument, to create an uncurried function, and return any number of results using a tuple. Tupled arguments may be provided with type declarations if desired.

All functions in Standard ML must accept at least one value, and produce at least one value, but you may not need them, as in a `print` function. In that case, you may accept a `unit` value as input, and return `unit` (`()`) as the result.

Refer to an operator, such as `+`, by using the `op` keyword.
