Standard ML has a `while` loop defined which may be used in place of recursion or higher order functions, wherein one expression is repeated while a condition holds.

Recursion and higher order functions tend to be preferred, as `while` only makes sense with a mutable condition, and Standard ML tends to prefer immutability.
