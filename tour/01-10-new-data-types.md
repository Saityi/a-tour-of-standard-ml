Type aliases may be defined using the `type` keyword.

New data types may be declared using the `datatype` keyword.

`major_arcana_card` declares a type, `major_arcana_card`, which is a pair of a name and number.

Data types may consist of multiple, exclusive cases. `card_suit` declares one type with four values, and `card_value` declares one type with fourteen values.
